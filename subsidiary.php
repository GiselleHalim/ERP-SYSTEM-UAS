    <p align="justify">Our country has a vast culture, be it history, rituals, arts, etc. One of the most popular
		culture in Indonesia is Batik. Batik is well-known not only in its own country, but also globally. But, with
		the surge of modern cultures coming in, Batik slowly lose its place in the younger generation. We couldn't let this go on,
		so we try to combine traditional and modern style of Batik to make a new style of fashion as a way to grow the love and
		to preserve the history of Batik, then ultimately, our country's identity.</p>
